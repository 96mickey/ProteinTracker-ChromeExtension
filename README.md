# chrome-extension

### This is a simple chrome extension. 

I made it with Html, css, json, javascript and some adobe photoshop for icon
This will help the user to count daily protein that must be fullfiled.

In order to test this chrome extension follow the steps below:

#1: activate developer mode in extension tab
<img aling="left" width="300" src="assets/developer.jpg" alt="clone this repository" />

<br/>
<br/>
#2: add the project folder to extensions
<img aling="left" width="300" src="assets/load.jpg" alt="clone this repository" />
<br/>
<br/>
#3: an icon will appear with the extensions tab
<img align="right" width="300" src="assets/icon.jpg" alt="clone this repository" />

Enjoy!
